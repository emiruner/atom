arun implements a very simple startup protocol. It accepts an object store file and object index,
prepares an object array containing the following elements:

 * a reference to memory (its kind is bytearray but it is a pointer to the C++ Memory class instance)
 * memoryControllerFn native function
 * printCString native function
 * loadLibrary native function
 * resolveFunction native function

Then it loads the given object store, sends this array as message to the given object specified by
object index.
